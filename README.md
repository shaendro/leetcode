# LeetCode

This is where I store my LeetCode solutions to have them accessible and editable in a sensible manner without having to rely on LeetCode Premium.

The project is built with SvelteKit to ensure good web performance and to further improve my development expertise.

## Developing

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

This uses the adapter-auto for SvelteKit, which detects Vercel and runs adapter-vercel on your behalf.

```bash
npm run build
```
